when create|edit an Employee : we need to pass the "$departments" to to the form , so we can use it in select
we can pass it , using the  $departments = department::all() in the Controller .

// in employee Controller
public function edit(Employee $employee)
    {
        $departments = new DepartmentCollection(Department::all());
        return view('employees.edit' , compact('employee' , 'departments'));
    }

// in resources.view.employees.edit
@section('content')
    @include('employees.includes.form' , ['employee' => $employee , 'departments' => $departments  ])
@endsection

# in the Form Select

the Wrong is :

    <div>
        <label for="department_id">Department</label>
        <select name="department_id" id="department_id"
        @class(['border-red-500' => $errors->has('department_id')])
        value="{{ $employee->department->id ?? old() }}"
        data-te-select-init data-te-select-filter="true"
        >
            @forelse ($departments as $department)
                <option value="{{ $department->id }}">{{ $department->name }}</option>
            @empty
                <option value="" disabled> there are no departments</option>
            @endforelse
        </select>
    </div>

The Rigth is :

     <div>
        <label for="department_id">Department</label>
        <select name="department_id" id="department_id"
            @class(['border-red-500' => $errors->has('department_id')])
            value="{{ $employee->department->id ?? old() }}"
            data-te-select-init data-te-select-filter="true"
        >
                <option value="">Select a Department</option>
            @forelse ($departments as $department)
                <option value="{{ $department->id }}"   // take care here to understand the case
                    @isset($employee)

                        @if($employee && $employee->department->id == $department->id )
                            selected
                        @elseif( $department->id == old('department_id'))
                            selected
                        @endif

                    @endisset
                >
                {{ $department->name }}
                </option>
            @empty
                <option value="" disabled> there are no departments</option>
            @endforelse
        </select>
    </div>
